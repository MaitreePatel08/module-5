# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler
We present a simple single-page Web App that we hope will be helpful to all sorts of workers that follow the traditional officespace 9am to 5pm grind. Its UI was designed with two things in mind:

1. Look as good as possible without being too distracting.

2. Be as intuitive and easy to use as possible.
The App was created through judicious use of the JQUERY library as a dependency, the Day.js utility library in order to get and format time and dates, and third-party APIs such as Google Fonts, the icon library Font Awesome, and the CSS framework Bootstrap.

## Usage 

Simply click on the textarea of the timeblock you want to alter and type in your schedule for the hour. When you are done, click the save icon and everything you typed for the timeblock will be saved in local storage for later use.
